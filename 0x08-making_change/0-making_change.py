    Args:
        coins (list): List of available coin denominations.
        total (int): The target total amount.

    Returns:
        int: Fewest number of coins needed to achieve the total. Returns 0 if total is 0 or less.
             Returns -1 if the total cannot be met by any combination of coins.

    Note:
        - coins is a list of the values of the coins in your possession.
        - The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than 0.
        - You can assume you have an infinite number of each denomination of coin in the list.
        - Your solutionâ€™s runtime will be evaluated in this task.
